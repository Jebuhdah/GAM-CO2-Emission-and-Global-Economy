# CO2-emission-in-relation-to-change-global-economic-environment
The cause of CO2 emissions are often considered highly relative with human activities, namely industrial 
productions. To further provide insight on information with bettered details on how human industrial 
production activities impacts on global CO2 concentration levels, this analytic will examine through the 
data showing CO2 concentrations observed from an observatory in Hawaii in contemporary times made 
available by the Scripps CO2Program at scrippsco2.ucsd.edu. The report will demonstrate the overall 
changes over the contemporary period starting from 1960 that saw the beginning of industrialization 
from former underdeveloped states like China, to the current year 2021, and will target two specific 
event that is widely known to likely have notably negative impacts on the global economics and 
industrial productions: the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and the global lockdown due to COVID-19 
pandemic starting in February 2020, with the hypothesis that these negative impact on the global 
economic will cause a slow-down in industrial production and a fall in CO2 concentration level.
